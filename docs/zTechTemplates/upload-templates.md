The **Upload Templates** feature allows you to easily add new project templates to the system for review and approval — all from within Excel.  

Using the upload window, you can:  
- 📁 **Select a Template File** — Choose an Excel file to upload. Only Excel files are supported to ensure consistency.  
- 🏗 **Select a Discipline** — Assign the template to a specific discipline such as *Bridge Engineering*, *Roads*, *Rail*, or *General*.  
- 📝 **Add Project Information** — Optionally include extra details like the **Project Name**, **Project Number**, and **Client Name** to keep your templates organized and identifiable.  
- 📤 **Upload for Approval** — Once everything is set, upload your template so it can be reviewed and approved by an administrator.  

This feature helps maintain a structured and traceable template library, ensuring that all templates are properly categorized and ready for use across your projects.
