The **Template Approval** page is where administrators review and manage templates that have been uploaded for approval.  

The approval window is divided into two main sections:  
- ⏳ **Awaiting Approval** — Shows templates that have been uploaded but not yet approved.  
- ✅ **Approved Templates** — Displays templates that have been reviewed and approved for use.  

Administrators can **view** a template to check its contents, then choose to **approve** it using the ✔️ icon or **disapprove** it using the ✖️ icon.  

Once approved, the template automatically moves to the **Approved Templates** column and becomes available in the **Template Browser** for all users to access.  

This process helps maintain quality and consistency by ensuring that only verified templates are shared across the team.

### Features:
